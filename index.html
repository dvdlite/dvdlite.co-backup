			 <p>🍿 The Blue Angels (2024) ★★★★½ - My wife and I really enjoyed this one. It was great to get an inside look at how the team is assembled and the camaraderie and trust amongst the pilots and the entire support staff. The in-flight photography was exhilarating and gave me a renewed respect for the precision of the pilots. Definitely worth a watch if you have even the slightest interest in aviation. <a href="https://letterboxd.com/dvdlite/film/the-blue-angels/">letterboxd.com/dvdlite/f&hellip;</a></p>

			 <p>Today, I attended a one-day &ldquo;Taste of Blacksmithing&rdquo; class conducted by Morrell Metalsmiths in Colrain, Massachusetts. This was a Christmas gift from my wife that had to be rescheduled several times, and today was finally the day!</p>
<p>We started off at 10am with some history of the shop, blacksmithing equipment, and safety.  Then we jumped right into making something.. a fireplace poker.  It was a ton of fun, even if it was hard work.  There were six of us in the class, all complete beginners, and we all came away with very passable tools!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here was my workstation for the day, with a nice anvil preset exactly for my height, and a propane forge more than adequate for today&rsquo;s job.  Some of the students used the larger coal forges which looked like fun. We were able to experiment with different hammers and tools to find what we were most comfortable using.  We wrapped up at around 3:30pm</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And here is my finished fireplace poker!  We will use it on our camping trips as it&rsquo;s a perfect companion to go with our Solo Stove.</p>
<p>It was a great day, and I look forward to exploring blacksmithing in future classes!  If this is something you&rsquo;ve had in the back of your mind to try, I would highly recommend finding a local blacksmith class and going for it!</p>

			 <p>How do I break the ice with the first post on my new blog?</p>
<p>Well, rather than dive into a tedious personal history or jump straight into some complicated deep dive into how to migrate from Proxmox to XCP-ng, let me start with this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This was the favorite photo I took in 2023.</p>
<p>This curved sky-bridge is part of The Mill in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts.  Originally built by Lamson &amp; Goodnow Cutlery in the mid-19th century, the buildings have been restored and currently house various artists and makers.  Lamson &amp; Goodnow, established in 1837, is the oldest cutlery manufacturer in the United States, and they still have a presence at this site. It&rsquo;s a beautiful location right below the falls and glacial potholes along the Deerfield River.  In fact, the entire complex is 100% powered by hydro-electricity.</p>
<p>I love how this structure interconnects two buildings that are not directly next to each other.  In fact, they are at different elevations.  Imagine the storms and winters those old boards and windows have weathered over more than 100 years!  Who has looked out through those windows? What were they doing and thinking? What did they see?</p>
<p>It would be a dream-come-true to have shop space in a place like this with so much history, heritage, and beauty.</p>
