Originally built by Lamson &amp; Goodnow Cutlery in the mid-19th century, the buildings have been restored and currently house various artists and makers.  Lamson &amp; Goodnow, established in 1837, is the oldest cutlery manufacturer in the United States, and they still have a presence at this site. It&rsquo;s a beautiful location right below the falls and glacial potholes along the Deerfield River.  In fact, the entire complex is 100% powered by hydro-electricity.</p>\n<p>I love how this structure interconnects two buildings that are not directly next to each other.  In fact, they are at different elevations.  Imagine the storms and winters those old boards and windows have weathered over more than 100 years!  Who has looked out through those windows?

Originally built by Lamson & Goodnow Cutlery in the mid-19th century, the buildings have been restored and currently house various artists and makers.  Lamson & Goodnow, established in 1837, is the oldest cutlery manufacturer in the United States, and they still have a presence at this site. It's a beautiful location right below the falls and glacial potholes along the Deerfield River.
